# Mentesinot-CS4395 (Human Language Technologies)

This is Mentesinot Cherenet Portfolio for class CS 4395.001(Human Language Technologies) 

These all assignments requires effective communication and analytical thinking skills to understand the problem, design a solution, and clearly present the program's results. Time and project management skills are also necessary to complete the assignment within the given timeframe. Flexibility and the ability to work independently are also essential to adapt to challenges that may arise during the project. 

# Portfolio_Assignment_0 Portfolio Setup

This assignment was to create a GitHub Portfolio for class to work using GitHub page.

# portfolio_Assignment_1 TextProcessing

The objective of this coding assignment is to gain experience in Python programming for text processing. 
For this coding assignment, the objective is to gain experience in coding a Python program that uses sysarg, writing a simple class in Python, coding regular expressions for text processing, and coding file I/O and pickling. The scenario involves reading in an file and processing the text to be more standardized, creating an object for each person with corrections from the user, and outputting each person's information. To complete the task, the user needs to specify the relative path 'data/data.csv' in a sysarg. The input file is then processed to modify the fields, such as the last name, first name, middle initial, ID, and phone number, according to specific requirements. The data is then saved to a dictionary of Person objects, and the dictionary is pickled and saved to a file. The user can then open the pickle file and print each person's information using the Person display() method to verify that the pickle was unpickled correctly.

# Portfolio_Assignment_2 Word Guessing game

The task is to create a Python program that uses NLTK features to explore a text file and create a word guessing game. The program should be able to:
Read the input file as raw text and calculate the lexical diversity of the tokenized text. Preprocess the raw text by tokenizing, lemmatizing, and doing POS tagging on unique lemmas to create a list of nouns. Then Create a dictionary of the 50 most common words and their counts. Finally, Create a word guessing game where the user is given 5 points to start with and must guess letters in a randomly chosen word from the top 50 list. The game ends if the user's score reaches negative or they guess '!' as a letter.

# Portfolio_Assignment_3 WorldNet

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate basic skills using WordNet and SentiWordNet and to identify collocations. WordNet is a lexical database of English words, which includes words, their meanings, and relationships between them. The assignment involves selecting a noun and a verb, outputting their synsets, and traversing up the WordNet hierarchy as far as possible. The assignment also includes finding the different forms of a word, running the Wu-Palmer similarity metric and the Lesk algorithm for two similar words, and exploring SentiWordNet and its possible use cases. Additionally, the assignment requires identifying collocations for text4, calculating mutual information for one of the collocations, and interpreting the results of the mutual information formula.

# Portfolio_Assignment_4_Ngrams

The objective of thsi assignment is to gain experience creating n-grams from text, building a language model from them, and reflecting on the utility of n-gram language models. The first program involves building separate language models for English, French, and Italian using the provided training data. A function is created that reads in the text, tokenizes it, and creates unigram and bigram dictionaries of counts. The dictionaries are pickled and saved to files for later use. The second program reads in the pickled dictionaries and calculates a probability for each language for each line in the test file. The language with the highest probability is written to a file, and the accuracy is computed and outputted.

# Portfolio_Assignment_5 Parsing Sentences

This assignment focuses on understanding concepts related to sentence syntax, including the three types of sentence parses: PSG, dependency, and SRL. The instructions include writing a complex sentence and hand drawing a PSG tree, a dependency parse, and an SRL parse of the sentence. Additionally, the assignment requires listing the predicate, arguments, and modifiers for each verb in the sentence and discussing their relationships. Finally, I wrote a brief paragraph summarizing the pros and cons of each parse type for the sample sentence.

# Portfolio_Assignment_6 Word Crawler

The objective of this project is to develop a web crawler and knowledge base for a given topic. The project involves understanding the importance of corpora in NLP tasks, basic HTML, and how websites work. The program should be able to scrape web pages using Beautiful Soup, clean up the text, and extract important terms using term frequency or tf-idf. The top 10 terms are manually determined based on domain knowledge, and a searchable knowledge base is built using Python dict. A sample dialog is also written to demonstrate how the chatbot would utilize the knowledge base.

# Portfolio_Assignment_7 Text Classification

In this assignment, the main objectives are to gain hands-on experience with text classification and sklearn using text data. The task requires finding a suitable text classification dataset, dividing it into train/test sets, and creating a graph showing the distribution of target classes. The model should be able to predict the classes accurately. Then, the student is expected to apply various machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks using sklearn and analyze their performance.

# Portfolio_Assignment_8 ACL Paper Summary

This assignment looks at one of the papers published for the ACL Conference and summarizes the problem and solutions discussed in that paper.

# Portfolio_Assignment_9 Text Classification_2

In this assignment, the main objectives are to gain hands-on experience with text classification and sklearn using text data. The task requires finding a suitable text classification dataset, dividing it into train/test sets, and creating a graph showing the distribution of target classes. The model should be able to predict the classes accurately. Then, I applied various machine learning models such as sequential mode, CNN, and embedding approaches using sklearn and analyze their performance.
